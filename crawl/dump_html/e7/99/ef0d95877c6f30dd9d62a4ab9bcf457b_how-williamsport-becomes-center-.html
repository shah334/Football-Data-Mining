<p>The Little League World Series fields in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, are a place of joy and civic pride for the townspeople and a shrine to youth baseball for the rest of the world. Taking part in the LLWS is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for players, but it takes an army of volunteers to pull off the annual tournament. ESPN.com took a peek behind the scenes to see how "the birthplace of Little League baseball" comes alive.

It's even listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Even though the field is no longer affiliated with Little League International, many call the field "The Birthplace of Little League Baseball." Here, Chris Pelletier rakes the pitcher's mound at the park. A chef who says he is between jobs, Pelletier has been volunteering at the field for several years. "When the kids smile, I smile," he said. "Little League Baseball is what Williamsport thrives on."</p>
